# ST558-Project2

In this project, I performed an analysis predicting the number of shares of Mashable articles. To make this prediction, I used a linear regression and a random forest, trained using the `caret` package in R. To compare the models, I predicted the number of shares on a test set and selected the model with the lowest test MSE. I automated R Markdown to perform a separate analysis for each day of the week. The 7 analyses can be found below.
